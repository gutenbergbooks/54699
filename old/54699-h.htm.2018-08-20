    <h2>
      ACT I
    </h2>
    <p>
      <i>Scene:</i> The Inner Hall at the Manor House in Brendon-Underwood
      village. An old-fashioned white-panelled room. At the back is a big
      stone-mullioned Tudor window looking out on to the garden. On the left of
      this is a bay in which is a smaller window. A door in the bay leads out
      into the garden. People entering by this door pass the window before they
      appear. The furniture is oak, mostly Jacobean or older. The right-hand
      wall of the room is mainly occupied by a great Tudor fireplace, over which
      the De Mullin Coat of Arms is carved in stone. Above this a door leads to
      the outer hall and front door. A door on the opposite side of the room
      leads to the staircase and the rest of the house. The walls are hung with
      a long succession of family portraits of all periods and in all stages of
      dinginess as to both canvas and frame. When the curtain rises the stage is
      empty. Then Hester is seen to pass the window at the back, followed by Mr.
      Brown. A moment later they enter. Mr. Brown is a stout, rather
      unwholesome-looking curate, Hester a lean, angular girl of twenty-eight,
      very plainly and unattractively dressed in sombre tight-fitting clothes.
      She has a cape over her shoulders and a black hat on. Brown wears seedy
      clerical garments, huge boots and a squashy hat. The time is twelve
      o&rsquo;clock in the morning of a fine day in September.
    </p>
    <h4>
      HESTER
    </h4>
    <p>
      Come in, Mr. Brown. I&rsquo;ll tell mother you&rsquo;re here. I expect she&rsquo;s upstairs
      with father (going towards door).
    </p>
    <h4>
      BROWN
    </h4>
    <p>
      Don&rsquo;t disturb Mrs. De Mullin, please. I didn&rsquo;t mean to come in.
    </p>
    <h4>
      HESTER
    </h4>
    <p>
      You&rsquo;ll sit down now you <i>are</i> here?
    </p>
    <h4>
      BROWN
    </h4>
    <p>
      Thank you (<i>does so awkwardly</i>). I&rsquo;m so glad to hear Mr. De Mullin is
      better. The Vicar will be glad too.
    </p>
    <h4>
      HESTER
    </h4>
    <p>
      Yes. Dr. Rolt thinks he will do all right now.
    </p>
    <h4>
      BROWN
    </h4>
    <p>
      You must have been very anxious when he was first taken ill.
    </p>
    <h4>
      HESTER
    </h4>
    <p>
      We were terribly anxious. [Hester <i>takes off her hat and cape and puts
      them down on the window seat</i>.
    </p>
    <h4>
      BROWN
    </h4>
    <p>
      I suppose there&rsquo;s no doubt it was some sort of stroke?
    </p>
    <h4>
      HESTER
    </h4>
    <p>
      Dr. Rolt says no doubt.
    </p>
    <h4>
      BROWN
    </h4>
    <p>
      How did it happen?
    </p>
    <h4>
      HESTER
    </h4>
    <p>
      We don&rsquo;t know. He had just gone out of the room when we heard a fall.
      Mother ran out into the hall and found him lying by the door quite
      unconscious. She was dreadfully frightened. So were we all.
    </p>
    <h4>
      BROWN
    </h4>
    <p>
      Had he been complaining of feeling unwell?
    </p>
    <h4>
      HESTER
    </h4>
    <p>
      Not specially. He complained of the heat a little. And he had a headache.
      But father&rsquo;s not strong, you know. None of the De Mullins are, Aunt
      Harriet says.
    </p>
    <h4>
      BROWN
    </h4>
    <p>
      Mrs. Clouston is with you now, isn&rsquo;t she?
    </p>
    <h4>
      HESTER
    </h4>
    <p>
      Yes. For a month. She generally stays with us for a month in the summer.
    </p>
    <h4>
      BROWN
    </h4>
    <p>
      I suppose she&rsquo;s very fond of Brendon?
    </p>
    <h4>
      HESTER
    </h4>
    <p>
      All the De Mullins are fond of Brendon, Mr. Brown.
    </p>
    <h4>
      BROWN
    </h4>
    <p>
      Naturally. You have been here so long.
    </p>
    <h4>
      HESTER
    </h4>
    <p>
      Since the time of King Stephen.
    </p>
    <h4>
      BROWN
    </h4>
    <p>
      Not in this house?
    </p>
    <h4>
      HESTER
    </h4>
    <p>
      (smiling)
    </p>
    <p>
      Not in this house, of course. It&rsquo;s not old enough for that.
    </p>
    <h4>
      BROWN
    </h4>
    <p>
      Still, it must be very old. The oldest house in the Village, isn&rsquo;t it?
    </p>
    <h4>
      HESTER
    </h4>
    <p>
      Only about four hundred years. The date is 1603. The mill is older, of
      course.
    </p>
    <h4>
      BROWN
    </h4>
    <p>
      You still own the mill, don&rsquo;t you?
    </p>
    <h4>
      HESTER
    </h4>
    <p>
      Yes. Father would never part with it. He thinks everything of the mill. We
      get our name from it, you know. De Mullin. Du Moulin. &ldquo;Of the Mill.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <h4>
      BROWN
    </h4>
    <p>
      Were the original De Mullins millers then?
    </p>
    <h4>
      HESTER
    </h4>
    <p>
      (<i>rather shocked at such a suggestion</i>)
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh no!
    </p>
    <h4>
      BROWN
    </h4>
    <p>
      I thought they couldn&rsquo;t have been. .
    </p>
    <h4>
      HESTER
    </h4>
    <p>
      No De Mullin has ever been in trade of <i>any</i> kind! But in the old
      days to own a mill was a feudal privilege. Only lords of manors and the
      great abbeys had them. The farmers had to bring all their corn to them to
      be ground.
    </p>
    <h4>
      BROWN
    </h4>
    <p>
      I see.
    </p>
    <h4>
      HESTER
    </h4>
    <p>
      There were constant disputes about it all through the Middle Ages.
    </p>
    <h4>
      BROWN
    </h4>
    <p>
      Why was that?
    </p>
    <h4>
      HESTER
    </h4>
    <p>
      The farmers would rather have ground their corn for themselves, I suppose.
    </p>
    <h4>
      BROWN
    </h4>
    <p>
      Why? If the De Mullins were willing to do it for them?
    </p>
    <h4>
      HESTER
    </h4>
    <p>
      They had to pay for having it ground, of course.
    </p>
    <h4>
      BROWN
    </h4>
    <p>
      (<i>venturing on a small joke</i>)
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the De Mullins <i>were</i> millers, after all, in a sense.
    </p>
    <h4>
      HESTER
    </h4>
    <p>
      You mustn&rsquo;t let father hear you say so!
    </p>
    <h4>
      BROWN
    </h4>
    <p>
      The mill is never used now, is it?
    </p>
    <h4>
      HESTER
    </h4>
    <p>
      No. When, people gave up growing corn round here and all the land was
      turned into pasture it fell into decay, and now it&rsquo;s almost ruinous.
    </p>
    <h4>
      BROWN
    </h4>
    <p>
      What a pity!
    </p>
    <h4>
      HESTER
    </h4>
    <p>
      Yes. Father says England has never been the same since the repeal of the
      Corn laws. (<i>Enter Mrs. De Mullin and Mrs. Clouston by the door on the
      left, followed by Dr. Rolt.</i>) Here is mother&mdash;and Aunt Harriet.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Mrs. De Mullin, poor lady, is a crushed, timid creature of fifty-eight
      or so, entirely dominated by the De Mullin fetish and quite unable to hold
      her own against either her husband or her sister-in-law, a hardmouthed,
      resolute woman of sixty. Even Hester she finds almost too much for her.
      For the rest a gentle, kindly lady, rather charming in her extreme
      helplessness. Rolt is the average country doctor, brisk, sensible, neither
      a fool nor a genius.</i>
    </p>
    <h4>
      ROLT
    </h4>
    <p>
      (as they enter the room)
    </p>
    <p>
      He&rsquo;s better. Distinctly better. A little weak and depressed, of course.
      That&rsquo;s only to be expected. Good morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      [<i>Shakes hands with Hester. Nods to Brown</i>.
    </p>
    <h4>
      MRS. DE MULLIN
    </h4>
    <p>
      Mr. De Mullin is always nervous about himself.
    </p>
    <h4>
      ROLT
    </h4>
    <p>
      Yes. Constitutional, no doubt. But he&rsquo;ll pick up in a few days. Keep him
      as quiet as you can. That&rsquo;s really all he needs now.
    </p>
    <h4>
      MRS. DE MULLIN
    </h4>
    <p>
      You don&rsquo;t think he ought to stay in his room?
    </p>
    <p>
      ... Good morning, Mr. Brown. Are you waiting to see me?
    </p>
    <p>
      [<i>Brown shakes hands with both ladies.</i>
    </p>
    <h4>
      BROWN
    </h4>
    <p>
      (<i>awkwardly</i>)
    </p>
    <p>
      Not specially. I walked over from the church with Miss De Mullin.
    </p>
    <h4>
      HESTER
    </h4>
    <p>
      Is father coming downstairs, mother?
    </p>
    <h4>
      MRS. DE MULLIN
    </h4>
    <p>
      Yes, Hester. He insisted on getting up. You know he always hates staying
      in his room.
    </p>
    <h4>
      HESTER
    </h4>
    <p>
      Oh, Dr. Rolt, do you think he <i>should?</i>
    </p>
    <h4>
      ROLT
    </h4>
    <p>
      I don&rsquo;t think it will do him any harm. He can rest quietly in a chair or
      on the sofa.... Well, I must be off. Good-bye, Mrs. De Mullin.

    </p>
    <p>
      I must be going too (<i>shakes hands with Mrs. De Mullin</i>). You&rsquo;ll tell
      Mr. De Mullin I inquired after him? Good-bye, Mrs. Clouston (<i>shakes

      Saturday, aren&rsquo;t you, Miss De Mullin?

    <h4>
      MRS. CLOUSTON
    </h4>
    <p>
      Quite remarkably. This Mr. Brown, for instance. He has the most enormous
      <i>feet!</i> And his boots! I&rsquo;ve never seen such boots!

    </p>
    <h4>

    </h4>

      Of course not Hester. Still, I think he goes to the opposite extreme. And
      he really is quite abnormally plain. Then there was that Mr. Snood, who
      was curate when I was down last year. The man with the very red hands. (<i>These
      acid comments are too much for Hester, who flounces out angrily. Mrs.
      Clouston looks up for a moment, wondering what is the meaning of this
      sudden disappearance. Then continues unmoved.</i>) I&rsquo;m afraid the clergy
      aren&rsquo;t what they were in our young days, Jane.

      It is there all the same. I&rsquo;m sure Hugo would agree with me. Of course,
      curates are paid next to nothing. Still, I think the Vicar might be more
      happy in his choice.

      I&rsquo;m a little nervous this morning. Hugo&rsquo;s illness...
    </p>
    <h4>
      MRS. CLOUSTON
    </h4>
    <p>
      Hugo&rsquo;s almost well now.
    </p>
    <h4>
      MRS. DE MULLIN

    <p>
      Still the anxiety...
    </p>
    <h4>
      MRS. CLOUSTON
    </h4>
    <p>
      Nonsense, Jane. Anxiety is not at all a thing to give way to, especially
      when there&rsquo;s no longer anything to be anxious about. Hugo&rsquo;s practically
      well now. Dr. Rolt seems to have frightened us all quite unnecessarily.
    </p>
    <h4>
      MRS. DE MULLIN
    </h4>
    <p>
      I suppose it&rsquo;s difficult to tell.
    </p>
    <h4>
      MRS. CLOUSTON
    </h4>
    <p>
      Of course, it&rsquo;s difficult. Otherwise no one would send for a doctor. What
      are doctors for if they can&rsquo;t tell when a case is serious and when it is
      not?

      was so serious....
    </p>
    <h4>
      MRS. CLOUSTON
    </h4>
    <p>
      Dr. Rolt was a fool.
    </p>
    <h4>
      MRS. DE MULLIN
    </h4>
    <p>
      Very likely, Harriet. But he said Hugo might die. And he said if there was
      any one Hugo would wish to see....
    </p>
    <h4>
      MRS. CLOUSTON
    </h4>
    <p>

    </p>
    <h4>

    <p>
      I thought he might. After all Janet <i>is</i> his daughter. Mrs. Clouston

    <p>
      He did <i>say</i> that, of course. But that was eight years ago. And, of

      She was so very obstinate. She was always getting some idea or other into
      her head. And when she did nothing would prevent her from carrying it out.
      At one time she wanted to <i>teach</i>.

      amused.

    <h4>
      MRS. DE MULLIN

    <p>
      Hugo did insist. He was terribly angry with her. He sent her to her room
      and said she was not to come down till she told us. But it was no use.
      Janet just stayed in her room till we had all gone to bed and then took
      the train to London.
    </p>
    <h4>

      We did. She got out of the window.

    <h4>
      MRS. CLOUSTON
    </h4>
    <p>
      Got out of the window! The girl might have been killed.
    </p>
    <h4>
      MRS. DE MULLIN
    </h4>
    <p>
      Yes. But Janet was always fond of climbing. And she was never afraid of
      anything.
    </p>
    <h4>
      MRS. CLOUSTON
    </h4>
    <p>
      But there&rsquo;s no late train to London.
    </p>
    <h4>
      MRS. DE MULLIN
    </h4>
    <p>
      She caught the mail at Weymouth, I suppose.
    </p>
    <h4>
      MRS. CLOUSTON
    </h4>
    <p>
      Do you mean to say she <i>walked</i> all the way to Weymouth in the middle
      of the night? Why, it&rsquo;s twelve miles.
    </p>
    <h4>
      MRS. DE MULLIN
    </h4>
    <p>
      She had her bicycle as I said.
    </p>
    <h4>
      MRS. CLOUSTON
    </h4>
    <p>
      Tck!... How did you know she went to London?

    <h4>
      MRS. DE MULLIN

    <h4>
      MRS. DE MULLIN
    </h4>
    <p>
      So Hugo said. However, he said I might send them. But he made me send a
      letter with the things to say that he would have nothing more to do with
      her and that she was not to write again. For a time she didn&rsquo;t write.
      Nearly five months. Then, when her baby was born, she wrote to tell me.
      That was how I knew she had taken the name of Seagrave. She mentioned it.

    </p>
    <h4>
      MRS. CLOUSTON.
    </h4>
    <p>
      I don&rsquo;t think you ought to hear from her, of course. But as you do hear
      naturally I should like to have seen the letters.
    </p>
    <h4>
      MRS. DE MULLIN
    </h4>
    <p>
      I didn&rsquo;t know that, Harriet. In fact, I thought you would rather not. When
      a dreadful thing like this happens in a family it seems best not to write
      about it or to speak of it either, doesn&rsquo;t it? Hugo and I never speak of
      it.

      I suppose so. She had her Aunt Miriam&rsquo;s legacy, of four hundred pounds of

    <h4>

      Yes.

    <h4>
      MRS. CLOUSTON

    <p>
      I never approved of that legacy, Jane. Girls oughtn&rsquo;t to have money left

    <h4>

    <p>
      Then she should have left the money to Hugo. Fathers are the proper people
      to leave money to.
    </p>
    <h4>
      MRS. DE MULLIN
    </h4>
    <p>
      Hugo did have the <i>management</i> of the money&mdash;till Janet was
      twenty-one.
    </p>
    <h4>
      MRS. CLOUSTON
    </h4>
    <p>
      Why only till she was twenty-one?
    </p>
    <h4>
      MRS. DE MULLIN
    </h4>
    <p>
      It was so in Aunt Miriam&rsquo;s will. Of course, Hugo would have gone on
      managing it for her. It was very little trouble as it was all in Consols.
      But Janet said she would rather look after it for herself.
    </p>
    <h4>
      MRS. CLOUSTON
    </h4>
    <p>
      Ridiculous! As if girls could possibly manage money!
    </p>
    <h4>
      MRS. DE MULLIN
    </h4>
    <p>
      So Hugo said. But Janet insisted. So she got her way.
    </p>
    <h4>
      MRS. CLOUSTON
    </h4>
    <p>
      What did she do with it? Spend it?
    </p>
    <h4>
      MRS. DE MULLIN
    </h4>
    <p>
      No. Put it into a Railway, she said.
    </p>
    <h4>
      MRS. CLOUSTON
    </h4>
    <p>
      A Railway! How dangerous!
    </p>
    <h4>
      MRS. DE MULLIN
    </h4>
    <p>
      She said she would prefer it. She said Railways sometimes went up. Consols
      never.
    </p>
    <h4>
      MRS. CLOUSTON
    </h4>
    <p>
      She lost it all, of course?
    </p>
    <h4>
      MRS. DE MULLIN
    </h4>
    <p>
      I don&rsquo;t know, Harriet.
    </p>
    <h4>
      MRS. CLOUSTON
    </h4>
    <p>
      You don&rsquo;t <i>know?</i>
    </p>
    <h4>
      MRS. DE MULLIN
    </h4>
    <p>
      No. I never liked to ask. Hugo was rather hurt about the whole thing, so
      the subject was never referred to.
    </p>
    <h4>
      MRS. CLOUSTON
    </h4>
    <p>
      Let me see. The child must be eight years old by now.
    </p>
    <h4>
      MRS. DE MULLIN
    </h4>
    <p>
      Just eight. It will be nine years next March since Janet went away.
    </p>
    <h4>
      MRS. CLOUSTON
    </h4>
    <p>
      What did she call him?
    </p>
    <h4>
      MRS. DE MULLIN
    </h4>
    <p>
      Johnny.
    </p>
    <h4>
      MRS. CLOUSTON
    </h4>
    <p>
      Johnny! None of the De Mullins have ever been called <i>Johnny</i>.
    </p>
    <h4>
      MRS. DE MULLIN
    </h4>
    <p>
      Perhaps it was his father&rsquo;s name.
    </p>
    <h4>
      MRS. CLOUSTON
    </h4>
    <p>
      Perhaps so <i>(pause)</i>.
    </p>
    <h4>
      MRS. DE MULLIN
    </h4>
    <p>
      Do you think I ought to tell Hugo about Janet&rsquo;s coming?
    </p>
    <h4>
      MRS. CLOUSTON
    </h4>
    <p>
      Certainly.
    </p>
    <h4>
      MRS. DE MULLIN
    </h4>
    <p>
      I thought perhaps....
    </p>
    <h4>
      MRS. CLOUSTON
    </h4>
    <p>
      Nonsense, Jane. Of course, he must be told. You ought to have told him
      from the very beginning?
    </p>
    <h4>
      MRS. DE MULLIN
    </h4>
    <p>
      Do you mean when I sent the telegram? But Hugo was unconscious.
    </p>
    <h4>
      MRS. CLOUSTON
    </h4>
    <p>
      As soon as he recovered consciousness then.
    </p>
    <h4>
      MRS. DE MULLIN
    </h4>
    <p>
      I did mean to. But he seemed so weak, and Dr. Rolt said any excitement....
    </p>
    <h4>
      MRS. CLOUSTON
    </h4>
    <p>
      Dr. Rolt!
    </p>
    <h4>
      MRS. DE MULLIN
    </h4>
    <p>
      <i>(goaded)</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, I couldn&rsquo;t tell that Dr. Rolt knew so little about Hugo&rsquo;s illness,
      could I? And I was afraid of the shock.
    </p>
    <h4>
      MRS. CLOUSTON
    </h4>
    <p>
      Still, he should have been told at once. It was the only chance.
    </p>
    <h4>
      MRS. DE MULLIN
    </h4>
    <p>
      Yes. I see that now. But I was afraid of the shock, as I said. So I put it
      off. And then, when I didn&rsquo;t hear from Janet, I thought I would wait.
    </p>
    <h4>
      MRS. CLOUSTON
    </h4>
    <p>
      Why?
    </p>
    <h4>
      MRS. DE MULLIN
    </h4>
    <p>
      You see I didn&rsquo;t know whether she was coming. And if she didn&rsquo;t come, of
      course there was no necessity for telling Hugo anything about it. I&rsquo;m
      afraid he&rsquo;ll be very angry.
    </p>
    <h4>
      MRS. CLOUSTON
    </h4>
    <p>
      At any rate, you must tell him now. The sooner the better.

      Because of it, Aunt Harriet. That&rsquo;s the advantage of being what is called
      &ldquo;in trade.&rdquo; If I were a school teacher or a governess or something genteel
      of that kind I could only afford to dress like a pauper. But as I keep a
      shop I can dress like a lady. Clothes are a question of money, after all,
      aren&rsquo;t they?

      On the contrary if one is in a shop it matters a great deal. A girl in a
      shop <i>must</i> dress well. The business demands it. If you ever start a
      hat-shop, Aunt Harriet, you&rsquo;ll have to dress very differently. Otherwise
      nobody will buy your hats.

    <p>
      Oh no. Dicky is my <i>cockatoo</i>. He&rsquo;s the <i>sweetest</i> bird. Talks
      quite like a human being. And never a coarse expression. That&rsquo;s so unusual
      with cockatoos.

      generally they pick up the most dreadful language, poor lambs&mdash;from
      the sailors.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Dicky didn&rsquo;t. He has such a pure mind <i>(rising)</i>. And now I

    </p>
    <h4>
      MONTY
    </h4>
    <p>
      Abroad with my regiment. We&rsquo;ve been ordered all over the place. I&rsquo;ve been
      home on leave, of course. But not for the last three years. Not since
      father bought the Park. I&rsquo;ve never been at Brendon since ... <i>(pause)</i>.
    </p>
    <h4>
      JANET
    </h4>
    <p>
      Since we were here? Don&rsquo;t blush, Monty. <i>(He nods shamefacedly.)</i> How
      did he come to buy the place?
    </p>
    <h4>
      MONTY
    </h4>
    <p>
      It was just a chance. He saw it advertised, came and looked at it and
      bought it. He&rsquo;s no idea I was ever at Brendon before <i>(rather bitter
      laugh)</i>. None of them have. I have to pretend not to know my way about.
    </p>
    <h4>
      JANET
    </h4>
    <p>
      Why?
    </p>
    <h4>
      MONTY
    </h4>
    <p>
      It seems safer. <i>(Janet nods.)</i> Sometimes I almost forget to keep it
      up. I&rsquo;m such a duffer about things. But I&rsquo;ve managed hitherto. And now, of
      course, it&rsquo;s all right as I&rsquo;ve been here three months. I may be supposed
      to know the beastly place by this time.
    </p>
    <h4>
      JANET
    </h4>
    <p>
      Beastly? You&rsquo;re not very polite.

    </p>
    <h4>
      MONTY

    <p>
      You got my note, didn&rsquo;t you?
    </p>
    <h4>
      JANET
    </h4>
    <p>
      What note?... Oh, eight years ago, you mean? Yes.
    </p>
    <h4>
      MONTY
    </h4>
    <p>
      I left it with the woman at the lodgings. As you were coming over that
      afternoon, I thought it safer than sending a message. And of course I
      daren&rsquo;t telegraph. <i>(Janet nods.)</i> I was awfully sick at having to go
      away like that. All in a moment. Without even saying good-bye. But I had
      to.
    </p>
    <h4>
      JANET
    </h4>
    <p>
      Of course. Was your mother badly hurt?
    </p>
    <h4>
      MONTY
    </h4>
    <p>
      No. Only stunned. That was such rot. If people get chucked out of a
      carriage they must expect to get stunned. But of course they couldn&rsquo;t
      know. The telegram just said &ldquo;Mother hurt. Carriage accident. Come at
      once.&rdquo; It got to me at the lodgings a couple of hours before you were
      coming. I had just time to chuck my things into a bag and catch the train.
      I wanted to come back after the mater was all right again. But I couldn&rsquo;t
      very well, could I?
    </p>
    <h4>

    </p>
    <h4>
      MONTY

    <p>
      Well, the regiment was to sail in less than three weeks and the mater
      would have thought it rather rough if I&rsquo;d gone away again. I&rsquo;d been away
      six weeks as it was.

    </h4>
    <p>
      Yes, a hat-shop, in Regent Street. My dear Monty, don&rsquo;t gape like that.
      Hat-shops are perfectly respectable places. Almost too respectable to
      judge by the fuss two of them made about employing <i>me</i>.

    <p>
      Well, when I applied to them for work they naturally asked if I had ever
      worked in a hat-shop before. And when I said &ldquo;No&rdquo; they naturally asked why
      I wanted to begin. In the innocence of my heart I told them. Whereupon
      they at once refused to employ me&mdash;not in the politest terms.

    <h4>

      JANET
    </h4>
    <p>
      My dear Monty, I quite understand what you mean. You needn&rsquo;t trouble to be
      explicit. Naturally they couldn&rsquo;t be expected to employ an abandoned
      person like me to trim hats. That was exactly their view.
    </p>

      Yes. But not at either of <i>those</i> shops. They were <i>far</i> too
      virtuous.

    <p>
      No. That was why I decided to be a widow. It made inquiries more
      difficult.

    <h4>
      JANET
    </h4>
    <p>
      On the contrary. You can&rsquo;t cross-question a widow about a recent
      bereavement. If you do she cries. I always used to look tearful directly
      my husband&rsquo;s name was even mentioned. So they gave up mentioning it. Women
      are so boring when they will cry.

      Governor would have made such a fuss. The Governor was so awfully

      All letters to the Manor House are delivered locked in a bag. They always
      have been since the Flood, I believe, or at least since the invention of
      the postal service. And, of course, father won&rsquo;t have it altered, So every
      morning there&rsquo;s the ritual of unlocking this absurd bag. No one is allowed
      to do that but father&mdash;unless he is ill. Then mother has the
      privilege. And of course he. scrutinizes the outside of every letter and
      directly it&rsquo;s opened asks who it&rsquo;s from and what&rsquo;s inside it. Your letters
      would have been noticed at once.

    <h4>
      JANET
    </h4>
    <p>
      Yes. Only at another shop. The Regent Street place had no room for me when
      I was well enough to go back to work. But the woman who kept it gave me a
      recommendation to a friend who was starting in Hanover Street. A most
      superior quarter for a hatshop, Monty. In fact <i>the</i> superior
      quarter. Claude et Cie was the name.
    </p>
    <p>
      (Monty <i>(rather shocked)</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      A <i>French</i> shop?
    </p>
    <h4>
      JANET
    </h4>
    <p>
      No more French than you are, Monty. It was kept by a Miss Hicks, one of
      the most thoroughly British people you can possibly imagine. But we called
      ourselves Claude et Cie in order to be able to charge people more for
      their hats. You can always charge fashionable women more for their clothes
      if you pretend to be French. It&rsquo;s one of the imbecilities of commerce. So
      poor dear Miss Hicks became Madame Claude and none of our hats cost less
      than seven guineas.
    </p>
    <h4>
      MONTY
    </h4>
    <p>
      Do people buy hats at such a price?
    </p>
    <h4>
      JANET
    </h4>
    <p>
      Oh yes. Everybody in Society bought them. Claude et Cie was quite the rage
      that Season. Nobody who was anybody went anywhere else.
    </p>
    <h4>
      MONTY
    </h4>
    <p>
      She must have made a great deal of money.
    </p>
    <h4>
      JANET
    </h4>
    <p>
      On the contrary. She made nothing at all and narrowly escaped bankruptcy.
    </p>
    <h4>
      MONTY
    </h4>
    <p>
      But I don&rsquo;t understand. If her hats were so dear and everybody bought
      them?
    </p>
    <h4>
      JANET
    </h4>
    <p>
      Everybody <i>bought</i> them but nobody <i>paid</i> for them. In the
      highest social circles I believe people never do pay for anything&mdash;certainly
      not for their clothes. At least, nobody paid Miss Hicks, and at the end of
      six months she was owed £1,200 and hadn&rsquo;t a penny to pay her rent.
    </p>
    <h4>
      MONTY
    </h4>
    <p>
      Why didn&rsquo;t she <i>make</i> them pay.
    </p>
    <h4>
      JANET
    </h4>
    <p>
      She did dun them, of course, but they only ordered more hats to keep her
      quiet which didn&rsquo;t help Miss Hicks much. And when she went on dunning them
      they said they should withdraw their custom. In fact, she was in a
      dilemma. If she let the bills run on she couldn&rsquo;t pay her rent. And if she
      asked her customers to pay their bills they ceased to be customers.

    <h4>

    </h4>
    <p>
      What <i>did</i> she do?
    </p>
    <h4>
      JANET
    </h4>
    <p>
      She didn&rsquo;t do anything. She was too depressed. She used to sit in the back
      room where the hats were trimmed and weep over the materials, regardless
      of expense. Finally things came to a crisis. The landlord threatened to
      distrain for his rent. But just as it looked as if it was all over with
      Claude et Cie a capitalist came to the rescue. <i>I</i> was the
      capitalist.
    </p>
    <h4>
      MONTY
    </h4>
    <p>
      You?
    </p>
    <h4>
      JANET
    </h4>
    <p>
      Yes. I&rsquo;d an old Aunt once who was fond of me and left me a legacy when I
      was seventeen. Four hundred pounds.
    </p>
    <h4>
      MONTY
    </h4>
    <p>
      That wouldn&rsquo;t go very far.
    </p>
    <h4>
      JANET
    </h4>
    <p>
      Four hundred pounds goes a longish way towards setting up a shop. Besides,
      it was nearly five hundred by that time. My shares had gone up. Well, I
      and my five hundred pounds came to the rescue. I paid the rent and the
      most clamorous of the creditors, and Miss Hicks and I became partners.
    </p>
    <h4>
      MONTY
    </h4>
    <p>
      But what was the good of that if the business was worth nothing?
    </p>
    <h4>
      JANET
    </h4>
    <p>
      It was worth several hundred pounds to any one, who had the pluck to sue
      half the British aristocracy. I sued them. It was tremendous fun. They
      were simply furious. They talked as if they&rsquo;d never been sued before! As
      for Miss Hicks she wept more than ever and said I&rsquo;d ruined the business.
    </p>
    <h4>
      MONTY
    </h4>
    <p>
      Hadn&rsquo;t you?
    </p>
    <h4>
      JANET
    </h4>
    <p>
      That business. Yes. But with the £1,200&mdash;or as much of it as we could
      recover&mdash;we started a new one. A cheap hat-shop. Relatively cheap
      that is-for Hanover Street. We charged two guineas a hat instead of seven,
      100 per cent, profit instead of... You can work it out for yourself. But
      then our terms were strictly cash, so we made no bad debts. That was my
      idea.
    </p>
    <h4>
      MONTY
    </h4>
    <p>
      But you said nobody ever paid for their hats.
    </p>
    <h4>
      JANET
    </h4>
    <p>
      Not in the highest social circles. But we drew our customers from the
      middle classes who live in South Kensington and Bayswater, and are not too
      haughty to pay for a hat if they see a cheap one.
    </p>
    <h4>
      MONTY
    </h4>
    <p>
      But wasn&rsquo;t it a frightful risk?
    </p>
    <h4>
      JANET
    </h4>
    <p>
      <i>(cheerfully)</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a risk, of course. But everything in life is a risk, isn&rsquo;t it? And
      it succeeded, as I felt sure it would. We&rsquo;re quite a prosperous concern
      nowadays, and I go over to Paris four times a year to see the latest
      fashions. That, my dear Monty, is the history of Claude et Cie.

    <p>
      My dear mother, when you have been thrown off a bicycle, ordinary
      conventions cease to apply. Besides, as a matter of fact, we <i>had</i>
      met once before&mdash;the day before, in fact.
    </p>
    <h4>

      Where?
    </p>
    <h4>
      JANET
    </h4>
    <p>
      Here. By this very stile. Monty was riding past and he asked me the way to
      somewhere&mdash;Thoresby, I think. I was standing by the stile. Next day I
      happened to ride into Weymouth. We collided&mdash;and the rest you know.
    </p>

    </h4>
    <p>
      <i>(sternly)</i>

    <h4>
      JANET
    </h4>
    <p>
      Of course not, mother. After the Weymouth collision we met constantly,
      nearly every day. We used to meet out riding and I had tea with him lots
      of times in his rooms.

      In order that Mr. Bulstead may marry you, of course. Your father will
      insist on his marrying you.

    <p>
      If father attempts to do that, mother, I shall deny the whole story. And

      fellow and I like him very much, but I don&rsquo;t want to pass the remainder of
      my life with him. If I&rsquo;m to marry anybody&mdash;and I don&rsquo;t think I shall&mdash;it
      will have to be a rather more remarkable person than Monty Bulstead.

      Nonsense, Jane, don&rsquo;t be foolish. We can&rsquo;t have <i>Janet</i> giving way to

    </p>
    <h4>
      MRS. DE MULLIN

      I&rsquo;m afraid she is rather irritable just now. She flew out quite savagely
      at Hester to-day just after luncheon.
    </p>
    <h4>
      MRS. CLOUSTON
    </h4>
    <p>
      Why was that?
    </p>
    <h4>
      MRS. DE MULLIN
    </h4>
    <p>
      Because of something she had been teaching Johnny. The Athanasian Creed I
      think it was. Yes, it must have been that because Johnny asked Janet what
      was meant by three Incomprehensibles. Janet asked him where he had heard
      all that and Johnny said Aunt Hester had taught it to him. Janet was very
      angry and forbade Hester ever to teach him anything again. Hester was
      quite hurt about it.
    </p>
    <h4>
      MRS. CLOUSTON
    </h4>
    <p>
      Naturally. Still, I do think Hester might have chosen something else to
      teach him.
    </p>
    <h4>
      MRS. DE MULLIN
    </h4>
    <p>
      That was what Janet said.
    </p>
    <h4>
      MRS. CLOUSTON
    </h4>
    <p>
      But that&rsquo;s no reason why she shouldn&rsquo;t behave herself when visitors are
      here. She was quite rude to Mrs. Bulstead. What they think of her in
      London when she goes on like this I can&rsquo;t imagine.
    </p>
    <h4>
      MRS. DE MULLIN
    </h4>

      Perhaps she isn&rsquo;t like this in London.
    </p>
    <h4>

      when early associations are all-important. Living here at Brendon in the

      My dear father, you&rsquo;re infatuated about your De Mullins. Who are the De
      Mullins, after all? Mere country squires who lived on here down at Brendon
      generation after generation. What have they ever done that I should want
      Johnny to be like them? Nothing. There&rsquo;s not one of them who has ever
      distinguished himself in the smallest degree or made his name known
      outside his native village. The De Mullins are, and have always been,
      nobodies. Look at their portraits. Is there a single one of them that is
      worth a second glance? Why they never even had the brains to be painted by
      a decent artist. With the result that they aren&rsquo;t worth the canvas they&rsquo;re
      painted on. Or is it board? I&rsquo;d make a bonfire of them if they were mine.

      I would. You seem to think there&rsquo;s some peculiar virtue about always
      living in the same place. I believe in people uprooting themselves and
      doing something with their lives. What was the good of the De Mullins
      going on living down here century after century, always a little poorer
      and a little poorer, selling a farm here, mortgaging another there,
      instead of going out into the world to seek their fortunes? We&rsquo;ve stayed
      too long in one place, we De Mullins. We shall never be worth anything
      sleeping away our lives down at Brendon.

      he is the son of Janet De Mullin who ran away from home one night eight
      years ago and whose name was never mentioned again by her parents until
      one fine day she turned up with an eight-year-old boy and said she was

      Janet, listen to me. You don&rsquo;t understand how your father feels about this
      or how much it means to him. Johnny is his only grandchild&mdash;our only

      to my mother properly by this time.
    </p>
    <h4>
      MRS. CLOUSTON
    </h4>
    <p>
      You certainly ought to, my dear. You are quite old enough.
    </p>
    <h4>
      HESTER
    </h4>
    <p>
      Very well then. Perhaps you will be good enough not to dictate to me in
      future. What was it you were discussing, father?
    </p>
    <h4>
      JANET
    </h4>
    <p>
      I&rsquo;ll tell you, Hester. Father wanted to adopt Johnny. He wanted me to come
      down here to live altogether.
    </p>
    <h4>
      HESTER
    </h4>
    <p>
      Indeed? Well, father, understand, please, that if Janet comes down here to
      live <i>I go!</i>
    </p>
    <h4>
      MRS. DE MULLIN
    </h4>
    <p>
      Hester!
    </p>
    <h4>
      HESTER
    </h4>
    <p>
      I will not live in the same house with Janet. Nothing shall induce me. I
      would rather beg my bread.
    </p>
    <h4>
      JANET
    </h4>
    <p>
      That settles it then. Thanks, Hester. I&rsquo;m glad you had the pluck to say
      that. You are right. Quite right.
    </p>
    <h4>
      HESTER
    </h4>
    <p>
      I can do without <i>your</i> approval, Janet.
    </p>
    <h4>
      JANET
    </h4>
    <p>
      <i>(recklessly)</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course you can. But you can have it all the same. You never wanted me
      down here. You always disapproved of my being sent for. I ought never to
      have come. I wish I hadn&rsquo;t come. My coming has only done harm to Hester,
      as she knew it would.
    </p>
    <h4>
      DE MULLIN
    </h4>
    <p>
      How harm?
    </p>
    <h4>
      JANET
    </h4>
    <p>
      Mr. Brown would have asked Hester to marry him if I hadn&rsquo;t come. He meant
      to; I&rsquo;m sure of it.
    </p>
    <h4>
      MRS. DE MULLIN
    </h4>
    <p>
      But he said...
    </p>
    <h4>
      JANET
    </h4>
    <p>
      I know. But that was only an excuse. Young men aren&rsquo;t so considerate of
      their future fathers-inlaw as all that nowadays. No. Mr. Brown heard some
      story about me from Miss Deanes. Or perhaps the Vicar put him on his
      guard. Isn&rsquo;t it so, Hester?
    </p>
    <p>
      [<i>Hester nods.</i>
    </p>
    <h4>
      MRS. DE MULLIN

      But as your father would never have consented, dear...

      HESTER
    </h4>
    <p>
      <i>(slowly)</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      Still, I&rsquo;d rather he had asked me, mother.
    </p>
    <h4>
      JANET
    </h4>
    <p>
      Quite right, Hester! I&rsquo;m glad you&rsquo;ve got some wholesome feminine vanity
      left in your composition. And you&rsquo;d have said &ldquo;yes,&rdquo; like a sensible
      woman.
    </p>
    <h4>
      HESTER
    </h4>
    <p>
      Oh, you&rsquo;re always sneering!
    </p>
    <h4>
      JANET
    </h4>
    <p>
      Yes. But I&rsquo;m <i>going</i>, Hester, <i>going! That&rsquo;s</i> great thing! Keep
      your eyes fixed steadily on that and you&rsquo;ll be able to bear anything else.
      That reminds me. <i>(Goes to door, l., and calls loudly into the hall.)</i>
      Johnny! Johnny!

      Really, Janet!
    </p>
    <h4>

    </h4>
    <p>
      Oh, I forgot. It&rsquo;s not genteel to call into the passage, is it? I ought to
      have rung. I apologise, Aunt Harriet. <i>(Calls again)</i> Johnny!

      Why are you calling Johnny?
    </p>
    <h4>
      JANET
    </h4>
    <p>
      To tell him to put on his hat and coat, mother dear. I&rsquo;m going to the
      station.

      You&rsquo;re going to-night?
    </p>
    <h4>

    </h4>
    <p>
      Yes, father, to-night. I&rsquo;ve done harm enough down here. I&rsquo;m going away.

    </h4>
    <p>
      Yes. Run and put on your things and say goodbye to Cook and Ellen and tell
      Robert to put in the pony. Mother&rsquo;s going back to London.

      Oh yes, I have. Everything&rsquo;s packed, down to my last shoelace. I don&rsquo;t

      all the time?
    </p>
    <h4>
      JANET
    </h4>
    <p>
      Yes, mother. I&rsquo;ve been wanting to leave you. I can&rsquo;t stay here any longer.
      Brendon stifles me. It has too many ghosts. I suppose it&rsquo;s your ridiculous
      De Mullins.
    </p>
    <h4>

    <h4>
      JANET
    </h4>
    <p>
      I know, father. That&rsquo;s blasphemy, isn&rsquo;t it? But I can&rsquo;t help it. I must
      go. I&rsquo;ve been meaning to tell you every day for the last four days, but
      somehow I always put it off.
    </p>
    <h4>
      DE MULLIN
    </h4>

      Understand me, Janet. If you leave this house to-night you leave it for
      ever.

      Understand, too, that if you leave it you are never to hold any
      communication either with me or with any one in it henceforward. You are
      cut off from the family. I will never see you or recognize you in any way,
      or speak to you again as long as I live.

    </h4>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      My dear father, why are you so angry? Is there anything so dreadful in my
      wanting to live in London instead of in the country?
    </p>
    <h4>
      DE MULLIN
    </h4>
    <p>
      <i>(getting more and more excited)</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      Why am I angry! Why am I...!
    </p>
    <h4>
      MRS. DE MULLIN
    </h4>
    <p>
      Sh! Hugo! You mustn&rsquo;t excite yourself. You know the doctor said...

    </h4>
    <p>
      <i>(quietly)</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh come, I could have got along quite well without a father if it comes to
      that. And so could Hester.
    </p>
    <h4>
      MRS. DE MULLIN
    </h4>
    <p>
      Janet!
    </p>
    <h4>
      JANET
    </h4>
    <p>
      Well, mother, what has father ever done for Hester or me except try and
      prevent us from doing something we wanted to do? Hester wanted to marry
      Mr. Brown. Father wouldn&rsquo;t have allowed her. He&rsquo;s not genteel enough to
      marry a De Mullin. I want to go back to my shop. Father objects to that.
      That&rsquo;s not genteel enough for a De Mullin either. Well, hang all the De
      Mullins, say I.
    </p>
    <h4>
      DE MULLIN
    </h4>
    <p>
      <i>(furious)</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      I forbid you to speak of your family in that way-of <i>my</i> family! I
      forbid it! It is an outrage. Your ancestors were honourable men and pure
      women. They did their duty in the position in which they were born, and
      handed on their name untarnished to their children. Hitherto our honour
      has been unsullied. You have sullied it. You have brought shame upon your
      parents and shame upon your son, and that shame you can never wipe out. If
      you had in you a spark of human feeling, if you were not worthless and
      heartless you would blush to look me in the face or your child in the
      face. But you are utterly hardened. I ought never to have offered to
      receive you back into this house. I ought never to have consented to see
      you again. I was wrong. I regret it. You are unfit for the society of
      decent people. Go back to London. Take up the wretched trade you practise
      there. It is what you are fit for.
    </p>
    <h4>
      JANET
    </h4>
    <p>
      That&rsquo;s exactly what I think, father. As we agree about it why make such a
      fuss?
    </p>

      Father, don&rsquo;t argue with her. It&rsquo;s no use. <i>(solemnly)</i> Leave her to
      God.
    </p>
    <h4>
      JANET
    </h4>
    <p>
      Hester, Hester, don&rsquo;t deceive yourself. In your heart you envy me my baby,
      and you know it.
    </p>
    <h4>
      HESTER
    </h4>
    <p>
      <i>(indignant)</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      I do not.
    </p>
    <h4>
      JANET
    </h4>
    <p>
      You do. Time is running on with you, my dear. You&rsquo;re twenty-eight. Just
      the age that I was when I met my lover. Yes, my lover. In a few years you
      will be too old for love, too old to have children. So soon it passeth
      away and we are gone. Your best years are slipping by and you are growing
      faded and cross and peevish. Already the lines are hardening about your
      mouth and the hollows coming under your eyes. You will be an old woman
      before your time unless you marry and have children. And what will you do
      then? Keep a lap-dog, I suppose, or sit up at night with a sick cockatoo
      like Miss Deanes. Miss Deanes! Even she has a heart somewhere about her.
      Do you imagine she wouldn&rsquo;t rather give it to her babies than snivel over
      <i>poultry?</i> No, Hester, make good use of your youth, my dear. It won&rsquo;t
      last always. And once gone it is gone for ever. <i>(Hester bursts into
      tears.)</i> There, there, Hester! I&rsquo;m sorry. I oughtn&rsquo;t to have spoken
      like that. It wasn&rsquo;t kind. Forgive me. <i>(Hester weep more and more
      violently.)</i> Hester, don&rsquo;t cry like that. I can&rsquo;t bear to hear you. I
      was angry and said more than I should. I didn&rsquo;t mean to vex you. Come,
      dear, you mustn&rsquo;t give way like that or you&rsquo;ll make yourself ill. Dry your
      eyes and let me see you smile. <i>(Caressing her. Hester, who has begun by
      resisting her feebly, gradually allows herself to be soothed.)</i> That&rsquo;s
      better! My dear, what a sight you&rsquo;ve made of yourself! But all women are
      hideous when they&rsquo;ve been crying. It makes their noses red and that&rsquo;s
      dreadfully unbecoming. <i>(Hester sobs out a laugh)</i>. No. You mustn&rsquo;t
      begin to cry again or I shall scold you. I shall, really.
    </p>
    <h4>
      HESTER
    </h4>
    <p>
      <i>(half laughing, half crying hysterically)</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      You seem to think every woman ought to behave as shamefully as you did.
    </p>
    <h4>
      JANET
    </h4>
    <p>
      <i>(grimly)</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      No, Hester. I don&rsquo;t think that. To do as I did needs pluck and brains&mdash;and
      five hundred pounds. Everything most women haven&rsquo;t got, poor things. So
      they must marry or remain childless. You must marry&mdash;the next curate.
      I suppose the Bulsteads will buy Mr. Brown a living as he&rsquo;s marrying the
      plainest of the daughters. It&rsquo;s the least they can do. But that&rsquo;s no
      reason why <i>I</i> should marry unless I choose.
    </p>
    <h4>
      MRS. CLOUSTON
    </h4>
    <p>
      Well, I&rsquo;ve never heard of anything so disgraceful. I thought Janet at
      least had the grace to be ashamed of what she did!
    </p>
    <h4>
      JANET
    </h4>
    <p>
      <i>(genuinely astonished)</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      Ashamed? Ashamed of wanting to have a child? What on earth were women
      created for, Aunt Harriet, if not to have children?
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. CLOUSTON To <i>marry</i> and have children.
    </p>
    <h4>
      JANET
    </h4>
    <p>
      <i>(with relentless logic)</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      My dear Aunt Harriet, women had children thousands of years before
      marriage was invented. I dare say they will go on doing so thousands of
      years after it has ceased to exist.
    </p>
    <h4>
      MRS. DE MULLIN
    </h4>
    <p>
      Janet!
    </p>
    <h4>
      JANET
    </h4>
    <p>
      Well, mother, that&rsquo;s how I feel. And I believe it&rsquo;s how all wholesome
      women feel if they would only acknowledge it. I <i>wanted</i> to have a
      child. I always did from the time when I got too old to play with dolls.
      Not an adopted child or a child of some one else&rsquo;s, but a baby of my very
      own. Of course I wanted to marry. That&rsquo;s the ordinary way a woman wants to
      be a mother nowadays, I suppose. But time went on and nobody came forward,
      and I saw myself getting old and my chance slipping away. Then I met-never
      mind. And I fell in love with him. Or perhaps I only fell in love with
      love. I don&rsquo;t know. It was so splendid to find some one at last who really
      cared for me as women should be cared for! Not to talk to because I was
      clever or to play tennis with because I was strong, but to kiss me and to
      make love to me! Yes! To make love to me!
    </p>
    <h4>

    </h4>
    <p>
      <i>(solemnly)</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      Listen to me, my girl. You say that now, and I dare say you believe it.
      But when you are older, when Johnny is grown up, you will bitterly repent
      having brought into the world a child who can call no man father.
    </p>
    <h4>
      JANET
    </h4>
    <p>
      <i>(passionately)</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      Never! Never! That I&rsquo;m sure of. Whatever happens, even if Johnny should
      come to hate me for what I did, I shall always be glad to have been his
      mother. At least I shall have lived. These poor women who go through life
      listless and dull, who have never felt the joys and the pains a mother
      feels, how they would envy me if they knew! If they knew! To know that a
      child is your very own, is a part of you. That you have faced sickness and
      pain and death itself for it. That it is yours and nothing can take it
      from you because no one can understand its wants as you do. To feel it&rsquo;s
      soft breath on your cheek, to soothe it when it is fretful and still it
      when it cries, that is motherhood and that is glorious!

law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
